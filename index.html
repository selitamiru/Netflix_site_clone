<!-- first go to the movie data base and download the API key so you can access the videos
    Api key- cd4c8a5a78b1d5e3f3819e39d278ffdb 
    example request- https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=cd4c8a5a78b1d5e3f3819e39d278ffdb
    i can also get from postman by pasting the url on the Get and you can get the details.

    step 2
    we can either use the fetch method by using the api key or use axios.
    we open new js file and import axios and use the create method ... it will create an instance 

    This is base url -https://api.themoviedb.org/3
    instance.get("movie/top_rated");....this will add to the base url and create the instance for us
    api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/top_rated
    
    if we export default export, then we can rename and call it whatever we want but if we only use export we can only that specific name

    use BEM naming convention Block, Element, Modifier
